# INTERSPEECH 2019

## Spoken Language Processing

### Special Session 1-6: Spoken Language Processing for Children’s Speech

- [x] Advances in Automatic Speech Recognition for Child Speech Using Factored Time Delay Neural Network [[INTERSPEECH 2019](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/abstracts/2980.html)]
  - `TDNN-F` `Data augmentation` `Vocal tract length normalization (VTLN)`
  - TDNN-F: Subsample + SVD

### Poster 1-A: Speaker Recognition and Diarization

- [x] Improving Aggregation and Loss Function for Better Embedding Learning in End-to-End Speaker Veriﬁcation System [[INTERSPEECH 2019](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/abstracts/1489.html)]
  - `Multi-stage aggregation (MSA)` `DALoss`

- [x] Speaker Augmentation and Bandwidth Extension for Deep Speaker Embedding
  - `Data augmentation` `DNN based bandwidth extension`
  - After voice conversion, e.g., speed perturbation, utterances should be assigned with new speaker labels
  - Use DNN to estimate missing filter banks for low-bandwidth features
